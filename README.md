4.  **Create a Long-Lived Access Token**:
    -   In Home Assistant, go to your user profile page.
    -   Scroll down to "Long-Lived Access Tokens" and click "Create Token".
    -   Name it (e.g., "LiveKit Agent") and copy the generated token.
5.  **Update your `.env` file** with the `HOME_ASSISTANT_MCP_URL` and `HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the Health Check**: Before starting, it's a good idea to run the health check to ensure all connections are working.
    ```bash
    python health_check.py
    ```

2.  **Start the Agent**:
    ```bash
    python agent.py console
    ```

3.  **Interact with the Agent**:
    Once the agent is running and connected to a LiveKit room, you can start interacting with it using its wake word.

    -   *"Friday, what's the weather in London?"*
    -   *"Hey Friday, turn on the living room lights."*
    -   *"Friday, set the bedroom light to blue."*
    -   *"Hey Friday, activate the movie time scene."*
